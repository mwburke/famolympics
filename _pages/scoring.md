## Judging

A yearly commissioner can be nominated to plan the games, establish rules and identify *third-party independent*<sup>*</sup> judges. The first year's commissioner will be Matthew, and the commissioner will nominate the next commissioner for the following year, who will most likely also be Matthew.

\* This is not true.

## Structure + Scoring

There will be 10 games, each person can choose 7 out of the 10 games they would like to participate in. At least 7 of the games will not require significant strenuous activity in order to accommodate the young, the elderly, and those of us who just aren’t feelin it that day.

For each game they participate in, the top 1st, 2nd and 3rd place winners will receive gold, silver and aluminum (hypothetical) medals for that event worth 10, 5 and 3 points respectively.

At the end of all 10 games, the winner is chosen based on the highest point total. 

In the case of a tie, we’ll figure something out. Maybe use a horoscope or something equally meaningless.

Also since we haven't figured out the games yet, the number of games is subject to change.

## Bonus Points

Bonus points can be awarded at the conclusion of all games (similar to Mario Party), based on some pre-defined, but secret categories to win.

## Prizes

The overall winner of the Famolympic Games will receive a trophy as a prize. The winner will be allowed to make a single modification to the trophy by adding an object to it and engraving their name on the bottom. 

The following year, the trophy will be brought back to the games, where it can be passed on to the next winner for gloating and modification.
